<h2 id="v2.2">Changelog 2.2</h2>
<ul>
	<li>2.2.2: Fixed a bug in the referrer check code and a typo in the documentation.
	<li>Phoenix Support!  The PrefBar now works in Phoenix release 0.5! Sorry it took me so long to get this in.</li>
	<li>Flash killing!  There is now a button to kill all flash embeds in the current page.</lu>
	<li>New buttons.  The following buttons have been added: <a href="#systemcolors">System Colors</a>, <a href="#cookiewarning">Cookie Warning</a>, <a href="#sendreferrer">Send Referrer</a>, <a href="#clearall">Clear All</a>, <a href="#size640x480">Resize 640x480</a>, <a href="#size800x600">Resize 640x480</a>, <a href="#size1024x768">Resize 1024x768</a>, <a href="#newtab">New Tab</a>, <a href="#killflash">Kill Flash</a>, <a href="#fontdown">Font -</a>, <a href="#fontup">Font +</a>.  See the <a href="buttons.html">button list</a> for more information</li>
	<li>Localization Support.  All the text strings have been moved to .dtd files in order to make the prefbar localizable.  I have already had three people volunteer to do the translations.





<h2 id="v2.1">Changelog 2.1</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Enabled rebuilding of missing config files, allowing the prefbar to be used easier with multiple profiles.</li>
	<li>Fixed the bug that was preventing the PrefBar from working on 1.2a.</li>
	<li>Made the edit button and new button dialogs reziable, and sized in ems rather than pixels.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bunch of typos in the documentation.</li>
	<li>Fixed a dozen or so small bugs pointed out to me by users.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="newbuttons">New Toolbar Buttons</h2>
<p>
There are a whole bunch of new toolbar buttons in the prefbar2 that weren't avaiable in previous versions.  This includes the new user agent menulist, navigation buttons, developer buttons, and several new pref checks.  See the <a href="buttons.html">Button List</a> for more information.

<h2 id="customization">Customizable Toolbar</h2>
<p>
The toolbar is now completely customizable, with not only the ability to show only the buttons that you want, but the ability to display the buttons in any order you want, and even edit existing buttons or add new ones.  Click the customize button on your toolbar to access the PrefBar customization panel, or find it in the "Advanced" catagory of the main preferences window.
</p>

<h2 id="shortcutkey">Shortcut Key</h2>
<p>You can now quickly show or hide the Preferences Toolbar whenever you need to by pressing the F8 key.  I was told that mac users would flame me for stealing one of their F keys, so I hope that doesn't happen.
</p>

<h2 id="documentation">Documentation</h2>
<p>I actually took the time to write a full featured documentation set for the PrefBar this time around (part of which you are currently viewing.)  This should make it a lot easier to use the PrefBar than previous versions, in which users pretty much had to figure everything out on their own.

<h2 id="license">License</h2>
<p>
The original Preferences Toolbar was licensed under the "assume it's MPL unless told otherwise" license that is quite common among small XUL applications.  The Preferences Toolbar 2 is now officially MPL/GPL/LGPL tri-licensed, including that huge bandwidth wasting license block at the first of every file.  Feel free to rejoice now.
