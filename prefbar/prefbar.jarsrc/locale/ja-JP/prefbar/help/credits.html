<h1>Credits</h1>
Just about everything to do with the PrefBar was done by me, but there are a few other people to whom I should give some credit, thus this page.

<h2>Special Thanks To</h2>
<p>
I'd like to thank the Producer, the Director, the whole cast...

<br><br>Adam Fletcher - Without whom I would never have learned how to manipulate RDF data, and we wouldn't have any customizable toolbars.

<br><br>Matt Kennedy - Who wrote the code that rebuilds the config file when it doesn't exist, making it much easier to use the prefbar with multiple profiles.

<br><br>Frank Nestel - My alpha tester, who put up with all my buggy software, including the version with the wrong install script.

<br><br>Fred Yontz - Who (without being asked) proofread all the prefbar documentation, pointing out to me all my misspellings, inaccuracies, and grammatical rule breaking.

<br><br>Dave Johnson - Who hacked together the first Phoenix compatible version of the PrefBar, and then didn't kill me when it took me <del>two</del> <del>three</del> four months to get it online.

<br><br>Chris Neale and  Johannes Eder - Who helped me beta test version 2.2 and make sure the all the new stuff (including Phoenix compatibility) worked as advertised.

<br><br>If you sent in a feature suggestion that eventually made it into the product (especially if you gave me the values to make it work) then your name belongs here.  Write to me and remind me of who you are and I'll make sure you get listed.

<br><br>The following members of #mozilla and #mozillazine who helped me resolve the many XUL problems I encountered while working on this program: biesi, BenB, caillon, jesus_X, oeschger, rginda, sirLurxalot, smontagu, ssieb, timeless, WeirdAl, and probably a few other people I forgot.


<br><br>Everyone who wrote me emails about version 1.0, whether to ask questions or just to say "thanks for making the prefbar".  You really made my day.  (Or more specifically, each individual one of you made my day the day that I received your particular email.)
